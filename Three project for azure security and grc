Project 1: Azure Compliance Monitoring and Reporting
Objective: Ensure compliance with industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, HIPAA) using Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager.
Steps:
1.	Enable Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager in the Microsoft Purview portal.
2.	Select the relevant compliance framework (e.g., NIST 800-53, ISO 27001).
3.	Assess compliance scores and generate reports.
4.	Automate compliance checks using Azure Policy to enforce security baselines.
5.	Generate compliance reports for audits.
Tools Used:
•	Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager
•	Azure Policy
•	Microsoft Defender for Cloud
Outcome:
•	Continuous monitoring of compliance status.
•	Automated policy enforcement for compliance adherence.
•	Audit-ready reports for regulators.

Project 2: Risk Management and Threat Assessment with Azure Security Center
Objective: Implement a Risk Management Framework (RMF) using Microsoft Defender for Cloud to assess and mitigate security risks.
Steps:
1.	Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud in Azure Security Center.
2.	Configure security policies to detect misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and threats.
3.	Use Secure Score to identify risks and prioritize mitigation strategies.
4.	Implement Azure Sentinel (SIEM) to correlate security logs and detect anomalies.
5.	Automate incident response using Microsoft Sentinel playbooks.
Tools Used:
•	Microsoft Defender for Cloud
•	Azure Policy
•	Microsoft Sentinel
•	Azure Logic Apps (for automated responses)
Outcome:
•	Real-time risk assessment and mitigation.
•	Improved security posture through automation.
•	Compliance with risk management standards (e.g., NIST RMF).

Project 3: Identity and Access Management (IAM) Governance
Objective: Strengthen identity governance by implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) and enforcing the least privileged access.
Steps:
1.	Enable Azure AD Identity Protection to monitor risky sign-ins.
2.	Configure Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to enforce just-in-time (JIT) access.
3.	Define Azure RBAC roles to limit user privileges.
4.	Implement Conditional Access policies for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
5.	Generate access review reports to ensure compliance with SOX, PCI-DSS, or NIST 800-53.
Tools Used:
•	Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
•	Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
•	Conditional Access Policies
•	Azure RBAC
